Please revise the landing page layout and styling according to the following detailed adjustments:

---

🖼 PRODUCT DISPLAY:

– I’ve uploaded the image `comic-front.jpg`  
– This image must be embedded inside the interactive flip-card – not displayed separately  
– On page load, only a subtle comic back texture should be visible  
– Once the user taps the card, it flips and shows the actual comic cover (`comic-front.jpg`)  
– Place the image directly inside the front side of the flip container and center it

---

⏱ COUNTDOWN FIX:

– Move the countdown timer to the very top of the page  
– Remove the solid red background – it’s too heavy  
– Replace it with a transparent or dark translucent background  
– Make the timer bold, large, and comic-style, but clean (no boxed digits)  
– Use a label like: “Drop Begins In:” and place it above the numbers  
– Make it full width, center-aligned on mobile  
– The font should be readable – no Comic Sans look

🖋 FONTS:

– Replace the current fonts with cleaner, modern alternatives that still fit the comic vibe:  
   - Headlines: `Bebas Neue` or `Anton`  
   - Body text: `Rubik` or `Teko`  
– Keep the layout clean and minimal – focus on spacing and rhythm  
– Use white or light gray text on dark background

🎨 STYLE REFERENCE: JUICE-THEMED VIBE (NO NAME, NO BRAND)

– Add subtle Juice WRLD–inspired visual elements WITHOUT using his name or branding  
– Examples:
   - Slight purple-pink gradient overlays  
   - Floating cloud textures or soft neon glow around the card  
   - Add 999-style abstract visuals (e.g. glitch lines, dreamy haze, etc.)  
– Make sure the vibe feels raw, emotional, floaty – but stays within original comic style

📱 MOBILE-FIRST:

– Ensure the full experience feels immersive on mobile:  
   - Large touch targets  
   - Centered layout  
   - Clean spacing and breathing room  
   - No unnecessary borders or boxes

Please apply these updates and tell me where to upload a matching back cover image next, if I want to include it in the flip-card.
